## 🧪 Overview

This repository houses the firmware, interface logic, and supporting scripts for automating and monitoring wet bench systems used in semiconductor or MEMS fabrication environments. Primary goals include:

- Reliablish control of chemical baths, DI rinse, and drain cycles  
- Hardware interfacing with sensors, valves, and pumps   
- Basic logging for debugging  
- System safety checks and interlocks (where applicable... to be installed in future itterations)

> _Note: This repo does not currently include real-time video monitoring of splash zones. That feature is pending further trauma._
